# Front End Programming for my [website](https://guyyatsu.me")
Understand that I don't really do much in the way of `front end` programming beyond adding remote
functionality for the end user.  That being said, these files represent what tooling is used on the
front end, such as form validation and collection as well as updating the page when viewing live
data streams.


## Java Scripts
  - `clientContactForm`: Provides validation for client sign up.
  - `liveAuctionChartData`: Provides real-time updates for live market data.
